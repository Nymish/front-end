       <p>A processor, or "microprocessor," is a small chip that resides in computers and other electronic devices.<br>Its basic job is to receive input and provide the appropriate output.<br>While this may seem like a simple task, modern processors can handle trillions of calculations per second.</p>

        <p>accelerometer sensor can be used to measure the acceleration exerted upon the sensor.<br>Usually the acceleration is given in two or three axis-vector components that make up the sum/net acceleration.<br>Accelerometers have quite a few uses.<br>You can probably think of a few alreadyâ€”glass breakage detector, video game remote controls, or even electronic bubble levels for when you are trying to hang a picture frame on the wall.</p>

       <p>A passive infrared sensor is an electronic sensor that measures infrared light radiating from objects in its field of view.<br>They are most often used in PIR-based motion detectors.<br>PIR sensors are commonly used in security alarms and automatic lighting applications.</p>
